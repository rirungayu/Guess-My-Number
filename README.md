# Guess-My-Number
this is a simple javascript project for a game. the computer generates a random number within a certain range. the player has to guess which number that is within a certain number of tries. the player can select the range and number of tries before playing. 
each combination of range and tries consists a level, which has a highscore and the person(s) who scored it. theis is displayed when a user selects a perticular combination level. 
the entire logic for the game is written in the bottom of the javascript file, as a comment. there is also a simple html file for display, and a css file for styling.
